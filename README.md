Adding new data to the table in the appropriate format. Error control.
In the sample Excel Sheet we start with table which looks like this: "A1" cell: "Date", "B1" cell: "Dealer", "C1" cell: "Product", "D1" Cell: "Profit". 
We want "Date" to be in the date format and the "Profit" in the currency format.
